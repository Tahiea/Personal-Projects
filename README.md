# Dengue Forecasting in Bangladesh Using SARIMAX and Machine Learning
Research Project: Master's in Data Science and Analytics 

This project explores forecasting dengue cases and deaths in Bangladesh by leveraging climate variables such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity. Using a combination of statistical and machine learning models—including SARIMAX, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gradient Boosting (GBM), and LSTM—this research aims to identify the most accurate approach for short-term dengue prediction based on monthly data from 2008 to 2025.
